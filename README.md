# Odin Project: Intro to CSS Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for the **Intro to CSS** exercises from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of these exercises is to practice different methods of adding CSS to HTML documents, including external, internal, and inline styles.

## Files

- **index.html**  
  Demonstrates the use of external, internal, and inline CSS methods.
- **styles.css**  
  Contains external CSS rules applied to elements in `index.html`.
- **README.md**  
  This file, describing the project and its structure.

## Exercise Overview

- The `<div>` element is styled using an **external stylesheet** (`styles.css`).
- The `<p>` element is intended to be styled using **internal CSS** (to be added in the `<head>` of `index.html`).
- The `<button>` element is styled using **inline CSS** (using the `style` attribute in the HTML).

## How to View

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the styled elements.

## What I Learned

- How to link an external CSS file to an HTML document.
- How to use internal CSS within the `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`.
- How to apply inline styles directly to HTML elements.
